### **Role-Based Command Permissions**  

- Most commands are now restricted based on roles configured via the `/tgc-managecommandroles` command.  
- The **`/tgc-profile`** and **`/tgc-openticket`** are **public** and can be used by anyone.  
- Other commands require the user to have a role specified in the `command_roles` table.  

---

### **How to Use**  

- To enable role-based command permissions:  
  1. Use `/tgc-managecommandroles action:add role:@RoleName` to add a role that can use restricted commands.  
  2. Repeat for each required role.  

- To remove a role from having permissions:  
  - Use `/tgc-managecommandroles action:remove role:@RoleName`.
